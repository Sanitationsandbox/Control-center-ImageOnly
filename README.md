This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

Before deploying, add an **Upstash for Redis** integration to the Vercel project.
The control API uses its shared Redis state so the preview does not reset when
Vercel routes polling requests to different serverless instances. Make sure the
integration provides either of these environment-variable pairs:

- `UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_URL` and `UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_TOKEN`
- `KV_REST_API_URL` and `KV_REST_API_TOKEN`

Redeploy after connecting the integration. Local development continues to use
in-memory state when those variables are absent.
